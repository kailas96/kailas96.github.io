                     <p>Kannanagat Bhagavathi is second in hierarchy among the goddesses in Muchilot Kavus. Kannanagat Bhagavathi’s story is linked with Lord Krishna. While in prison, Devaki delivered her eighth son, Lord Krishna. To save the kid from Kamsa, her husband Vasudeva took him to Ambadi and substituted Yashoda’s baby girl child for his. He presented this girl child as his own. When Kamsa tried to kill this child fearing the forecast by a divine voice - which said that Devaki’s eighth child would kill him. But the child escaped from Kamsa’s hands and told Kamsa that his sssssssssssssssssssssssssssss ‘Kannan’ is already born and alive..</p>
                     <p>
                        This Bhagavathi is known as Kannanagat Bhagavathi. ”Kannane kattiya Bhagavathi” which means Bhagavathi who has shown lord Krishna. Kannanagat Bhagavathi is also worshipped by Maniyani community.

                     <p>Pollur Kali is the goddess and Pullur Kannan is male god. They are Puli (tiger) theyyams. The story about both theyyams goes like this: Lord Shiva and wife Parvati were living in a forest as tigers. After a while, five tiger cubs were born. They were named as Kanda Puli, Mara puli, Kala puli, Puliyoor Kannan, Pullur kali. Immediately after the birth Shiva and Parvati gave blessings to the cubs and left for Kailasa.</p>
                     <p>The cubs played in the forest and started moving out of the forest once they became little older. They started moving around the village outside the forest. One day they ate cows belonging to Karumbranthiri Vanavar. He got angry sent Karinthiri Nair to kill the tigers. He also met the same fate as the cows. After seeing no sign of Karinthiri Nair coming back from the forest, Karumbranthiri Vanavar set off to look for him. His servants could not move the cart in which he was supposed to travel. He started praying to his family goddess and the cart started moving. Then he heard a divine voice saying that they are not ordinary tigers, they are gods in the form of tigers and Karinthiri Nair is with them. Karumbranthiri Vanavar consulted with astrologers and started performing theyyam for tiger gods and Karinthiri Nair.</p>

                     <p>The story behind Moovalamkuzhi Chamundi revolves around rivalry between two Thanthri families. In between their tantric rituals, Chandika devi ( incarnation of goddess Durga) was born. Chandika devi was a peace loving goddess. One of the Thanthris locked the goddess in a chembu pathram (copper vessel) and buried it in a hole which was so deep that three people could stand on top of each other and still be underground. Devi was so powerful that she came out of the ground and ran after the enemies. As she reached Thrikkannad Shiva temple Lord Shiva calmed her down and gave her a place on the south of the temple. After this, devotees started worshiping Moovalamkuzhi Chamundi in Thrikkannad and surrounding temples.</p>

                     <p>Vishnumoorthy is one of the Theyyams worshipped at all Muchilot kaavus. Vishnumoorthy represents one of the incarnations of Lord Vishnu. Vishnumoorthy is actually the Narasimham avatharam, who killed Hiranyakashipu and blessed Prahladhan.</p>
                     <p>It tells the story of Palanthai Kannan, a great devotee of Lord Vishnu. Palanthai Kannan, a native of Nileshwar in his boyhood, tried to pick mangoes from a mango tree owned by Kuruvatu Kurup. Without considering his age or the thirst for food, Kuruvat Kurup and his bodyguards beat him and drove away from Nileshwar. After that incident, Palanthai Kannan went to Mangalore and took shelter in a Vishnu temple there. There he obtained the blessings of Lord Vishnu and years later, he returned to his homeland, Nileshwar. Within a short time, the news of the arrival of Palanthai Kannan spread in all across Nileshwar, Kadalikulam. Hearing the news, Kuruvat Kurup and his men came to the Kadalikulam and killed Palanthai Kannan. The God Vishnu who accompanied his ardent devotee Palanthai Kannan was provoked and destroyed everything near by Kuruvat tharavad. Kuruvat kurup frightened and call an astrologer. He identified the presnece of God and advised Kurup to a make a Kettikkolam for Lord Vishnu and build a shrine for the God which is being worshipped as Vishnumoorthi.</p>

                     <p>In Nekraje of Kumble seeme there was a carpenter Perikolli who had a sword named “Palli Balu”. He worshipped that sword. One day a young man named Beernalva came to his shop asking for a sword. Suddenly a daiva entered his body and took “Palli Balu”.This theyyam solved many problems of Kumbla Seeme.</p>
                     <p>When Shree Muchilot Bhagavathi came from Karivellur to settle in Kumbla seeme, she first went to Bedradka Poomani-Kinnimani Kshetra. She was instructed to ask the permission of Adoor Mahalingeshwara. Beernalva daiva guided her to Adoor temple and then to Perne. Hence, there is a shrine for Beernalva in Perne.</p>

                     <p>God Shiva sent Bootas or Ganas to earth and asked them to receive offerings from human beings and protect them. These bootas settled in the places where they received respect and offerings. One such boota came to a place named “malaaru” in Tulundadu. It saw an honest bunt family head who was the great devotee as well. It entered his body and started showing miracles and protected the village. That village head “mallar" in tulu was later worshipped as Malaraya daiva. Mainly bunt family worship this god. Perne had the influence of Icchilampadi, Kotekunja bunt family  maybe that's the reason Malaraya is being worshipped in Perne.</p>

                     <p>There have been historical references to Dhumraksha(Dhumasura) who is believed to have been creophagous and caused carnage of civilisations. He enjoyed a boon whereby he could be killed only by a person who was a man and a woman at the same time. Devotees prayed to Lord Shiva to solve their misery. Lord Shiva and his consort Parvati descended from mount Kailasa to vanquish the demon. On their way, Parvati felt uncontrollably hungry. Shiva tried to satisfy her hunger through various ways but she could not be satisfied. At last, Shiva told Parvati to eat him to satisfy her hunger. Goddess Parvati tried to swallow Shiva, but Shiva would not go beyond her throat. At that moment, Shiva and Parvati merged and transformed into Raja Daiva, a male-female form. Raja Daiva had the face of a man and the part below the throat was that of a woman. In the throat of Raja Daiva was the sacred lingam and Raja Daiva wore a crown of nagas (snakes). Raja Daiva vanquished Dhumasura and thus became known as Dhumavathi – "the vanquisher of Dhumasura". Later, Raja Daiva took various other forms to vanquish other of Dhumasura's demon associates. This Raja Daiva/Dhoomavathi is being worshipped as Pandinhar Chamundi in Kumble seeme.</p>
