            <p>
              Perne, the dwelling place of Godess Bhagavathi is affliated with rich tradition and has vivid aestheticism that dates back to over 260 years. Approved of the tradition, culture and hospitality, Vaniya Community decided to inhabit in tulunadu on the Western Ghats and hence were called GANIGA’s. As Tulunadu is significantly afar from their inborn places, Ganigas came into an accord and decided to establish a Muchilot Kavu and thus the place Perne was found.

            <div class="subheadingLeft">Maipady Kings And Perne</div>
            <p>
               Perne was part of Kumbla seema, which was administrated by Maipady king. Vaniya's approached the Maipady rulers and sought their consent to build “Kavu”. Their wish was granted and the Maipady kings upheld a pleasant relationship with Vaniya commnity. Maipady kings did not middle in the administration of Perne. As a part of the tradition, Ganiga’s choose Komaram for Muchilot Bhagavathi and other daiva’s. He is entitled with this official status of Komara only after the Maipady king accaims him and bestow’s him with a golden bracelet. Golden bracelet symbolises that he is the Darshana Padri of Daiva.

              Whenever a event or festival is celebrated in Perne, the family of Maipady dynasty is informed and invited. Kaliyatam is recognised with Daiva’s visiting the palace to interact with the people of the royal family. Vaniya’s even sought the blessings of traditional holy places of Kumbla Seema such as Madhur Ganapathi, Adoor Mahalingeshwara, Kavu Parthasarathi, Kanipura GopalaKrishna, Ananthapura Padbhanabha. Darshana padri’s narrate the stories of these gods during festivals at Perne to symbolise that relationship.

         <p>
           Vaniya's from five seema’s contributed monetarily as per their ability to the construction of the temple. The place was owned by Ananthapura Stanika Bramins and they bestowed their land for this holy purpose. Vaniya’s of Kutyala Majal and Olal taravadu committed and exerted their effort in building the Kavu, Well, and the Bhandara house. All the religious conventions are carried out by the Komara’s and the Komara of Bhagavathi Devi is the most significant person. All the activities of Kshetram are spearheaded by him.The pooja related activities are organised and undertaken by the four chosen adiyantararu(Naltyararu), all four have got equal eminence.The nine Karnavamars have charge of social actvities, the first four enjoy more prominence. These people function with the assistance of Chettiyanmar, Raddek Acchanmar and Pattikarmar who collect house rent(“Mane Denige”). All these efforts for years now, has and is contributing towards the smooth running of the Kshetram, making it a divine and auspicious place it is now. 
         </p>
         <p>
            Uliya Tantri carried out all the religious activities of Kshetram until hundred years ago. Under him, Bal Bhandharah was placed in Uliya Palace and was brought to the Kshetram during festivals. Icchilapadi Bhant family expressed their liking and authority in the activities of Perne. All the social and religious leaders were involved and invited to the religious activities of Kshetra.

            <p>
             In 1980, the difference of opinion leads to the division of Vaniyas into two. 1986 marked the clash over Kaliyatam that ended in the interference of sub magistrate Puttur and police to conduct Kaliyatam. After that Icchilpadi Kotyanna Bhanta and his loyal vaniya's filed a case in Puttur Magistrate court and Kasargod Magistrate court claiming the rights on Perne. The group that opposed this handover of rights sought the help of Patela of village, Ananthapura Ishwarayya (Stanika Brahmin). With his help they won the case, was awarded to be the Adalitha Muktheshwara of the Kshetram and become the mentor of Vaniya community
            </p>
            <p>
              Even now Stanika Brahmins are regarded with utmost respect and love by the community. Ananthapura family has shown a lot of eagerness to the progress of the community. One of the Muktheshwara, Sri Shanakra Narayanayya has donated paddy land for the temple. In the turn of events, Uliya Tantri backed off from all the activities of Perne. Later Bal Bandara was kept at Ananthapura and now Kalasa Sthana is being carried out in the Ananthapura temple. Every Year during the festival, Acchanmar and Nalthyars visit Ananthapura temple, perform Kalasa Sthana and they return with Bal Bandara. At the end of festival, the bhandara is taken back along with banana cluster.
            </p>
           Muktheshwara is regarded with great respect. He is offered a separate seat in Sathya Chavadi and his responsibility is to solve all the issues related to the Kshetram. During Kaliyatam, Daiva converses with him first, he gets to have Prasadam before everyone else. It's a relationship of trust and love completely enthriled with devotion to the devi that carries all the people forward.

               <p>The Vaniya community mainly were oil vendors and were setteled in various parts of Kerala/South Karnataka. The culture and language of community varied depending upon the location. Once the group of Vaniyans from North Kerala attended Kaliyata Mahotsavam in Karipodi. People of Karipodi who were jealous with culture and lifestyle of North Kerala planned to insult them. They mixed the itching leaves of a plant (Nayi Sonaga) into water used for washing hands. Innocent Vaniyas of North, who washed their hands and bathed in that water faced itching, burning of the skin, swelling, and watery blistering.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Devotees from North Kerala realised the trick played by people of Karipodi. They gathered together and prayed to Devi and explained the insult. They also made the promise that they will never visit Karipodi again and left Karipodi same day night. Devi heard their prayers and blessed them. She came along with them. They reached a place called Chandragiri. They had to cross the river, but there was no boat available since it was dawn. They were worried and started praying again. Devi entered the body of “Chorla Vaniya” and he divided the river into two using Knife. Once everyone crossed, river joined again.
               </p>
                <p>
                 Due to all these events Vaniyas got a strong feeling that Devi has come along with them. After entering north, Bhagavathi devi went to Bedradka Poomani Kinnimani temple where the festival was going on. A Chorla Vaniyana of Majal ancestry used to light lamps in that temple. During Beernalva Daiva Utsthava, Bhagavathi enters the body of Chorla Vaniya and asks for the permission to settle. Beernnalva directs Devi to ask permission from Mahalingshwera Deva of Kumbla seeme. Beernalva shows the path to Mahalingeshwara temple and asks for a shrine to him in a place where Bhagavathi devi settles. Since Devi dharshana happened on Chorla vaniyan of Majal ancestry, Komara of Perne Muchilot Bhagavathi Devi belongs to Chorla. During Kaliyata mahostavam, the things used for initial Ganapathi pooja (rice,coconut,banana) etc are preserved and taken to Majal house after Kaliyatam. Dinner is arranged there for people of the community.

               Bhagavathi enters Adoor Mahalingashivara temple where a festival was going on and asks for a place in Kumbala seema. The person who was(Adigalu) carrying Bali of god rejects the request and deny’s the place. Saddened by it Devi curses the Adigalu that he would not be able to keep the god down and sits at a place called Iruvanji near the temple. At the end of function Adigalu on tying to keep Bhali down he fails. Adigalu realises his mistakes and grants the permission to her to settle. He advises to take permission from Madhur ganapathi, Kanipura Gopalakrisha and Mujungavu Parthasarathi. She searches for a place to settle and finds a place where cow,tiger, snake and magnoose lived happily. It was a place where “Ashwatha plant and Blinder plant was found. This place was “Peru tana”. In Peru tana inside satya chavadi (padipura) sage was praying.
