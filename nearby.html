                  Ananthapura Lake Temple is a Hindu temple located in the middle of a lake in the Kasaragod District of Kerala, South India, at around 6 km from Kumbala. This is the only lake temple in Kerala and is believed to be the original seat (Moolasthana) of Ananthapadmanabha Swami Padmanabhaswamy temple) Thiruvananthapuram. Legend has it that this is the original site where Ananthapadmanabha settled down. The temple's lake is also home to a crocodile named "Babiya", which is supposed to be the guard of the temple. When one dies, another mysteriously takes its place. The Temple lake or tank in which the Sanctum is situated is a large structure measuring 302 feet square (about 2 acres).
               </p>
               <p>
                  There is a cave to the right corner of the lake, which has a gate. According to the priests of the temple, god AnanthaPadmanabha went to Thiruvananthapuram through that cave. Hence the names of both the places are a bit similar. Also there is a difference in the God idols places in both the temples. the one in Ananthapuram is standing idol and the other in Thiruvananthapuram is a reclining posture.

                 Madhur temple is one of the most famous Ganapathi temples of six ganpathi temples of ancients Tulunadu. Devotees from all over visit during the various festivals that happen here. Devotees usually offer prayers to Mahaganapathi in the form of "Udayastamana". "Appa", Madhur's famous prasad, is a very tasty preparation.Among the special poojas that are performed, "Sahasrappa" (Thousand appas) is very prominent. It consists of making an offering of thousand appas. Another very special pooja that happens is MoodappamSeva which involves covering the Mahaganapathi statue with Appam. This is usually done on a community scale. Ganesh Chaturthi and Madhur Bedi are the occasions when the temple is at its busiest.

               During the rainy season, a river adjoining the temple overflows and spills onto the temple campuses and thus this is not the best time to visit the temple. The temple is busier on Sundays than on weekdays
